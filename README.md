### Introduction
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pinocchio315
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I have a PhD in Geometry and Mathematical Physics.
- 👀 I’m also interested in machine learning, AI and big data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning LLMs such as OpenAI, Gemma, and LangChain framework.
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I'm now working as a post-doctoral researcher in POSTECH.

### My Tech Stack
- Python
- C++
- Pytorch, Pytorch-geometric(GNN)
- Tensorflow, Keras
